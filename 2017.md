2017
====

I'm actually going to set some goals for 2017. 2016 was a year with a very
vague, undefined goal: "be happier". At the end of 2015, I had just left a great
company (Rackspace) and a great city (San Francisco) to move closer to home
(Chicago) and be the first engineering hire at a startup (Triggr Health). Within
the first month and a half at Triggr, we had a massive failure with one of our
providers that necessitated essentially rebuilding the whole backend from the
ground up. Lots of very long hours through the holidays and into the new year
meant I didn't really have time to stop and think about the next year. When some
days you wake up, write code, eat lunch, write code, eat dinner, play an hour of
video games, then write more code until you pass out, it's a bit hard to take a
critical look at your life and decide on goals.

Good news though: I succeeded at my goal! I found a life-work balance after we
finished the backend rewrite (phew!). I became closer to my coworkers and added
a bunch more awesome coworkers. I hung out with friends more often. I went on a
couple adventures: canoeing in the Boundary Waters, backpacking Shawnee National
Forest with my sister, coffee adventures in LA with my best friend, a relaxing
trip to Cozumel, and went to a bunch of concerts, including an awesome Umphrey's
McGee show to ring in the new year. I started working out (somewhat) regularly.
I ate even healthier than 2015 and got to the lowest weight I've been since I
reached my adult height. I've improved my focus with meditation and deep work.

For 2017, I want to build on 2016's happiness goal with a focus on physical and
mental happiness:

Meditate daily - I can already tell the difference in the way my mind works from
doing mindfulness meditation sporadically. I need to make this a daily habit to
enable me to kick ass at my other goals. If there was one thing I could
recommend for my friends and family to try and do in 2017, it would be
meditation.

Work out 4x week - I'm pretty close to my goal weight, so it's about time to
start adding in more strength training to my cardio workouts. I started running
for part of 2016 but switched to biking after my shins started killing me. I'm 
going to give running another try this year and aim for running a 5k.

Go skydiving - It terrifies me, so I should probably do it. 

Read a book a month - I've been compiling a list of books from people I admire
and now I need to read them. Feel free to suggest more!

* Infinite Jest - in progress, but it's long enough I'm gonna count it for 2017.
* Glass Castle - my girlfriend's favorite book
* Zen and the Art Of Motorcycle Mainentance - how to live better
* Heavier Than Heaven - a Kurt Kobain biography. Addiction is our focus at
  Triggr Health, so books about famous addicts are especially interesting to me.
  I really enjoyed Scar Tissue, the story of Red Hot Chilipeppers frontman
  Anthony Kiedis, so I'm hoping I enjoy this one as well.
* Debugging Teams - a book by a few Googlers on being more productive in teams
* The Non-Designer's Design Book - I'm terrible at design. This seems like a
  great place to start to fix that.
* The Art of Learning - I listened to the author in a Tim Ferriss podcast and
  was very intrigued.
* Daily Rituals: How Artists Work - Recommended by both Tim Ferriss and the
  author of The Art of Learning
* The Hard Thing About Hard Things - a seemingly classic book amongst startup
  people, written by the fascinating Ben Horowitz, an entrepreneur and VC.
* Tools of Titans - A condensed version of the Tim Ferriss show
* Cryptonomicon - I started this book after I finished Snow Crash and really
  enjoyed Stephenson's writing. It's a weighty tome and I never finished it.
* Devil in the White City - A true story of a serial killer in Chicago in 1893.

Complete four classes - I would like to do 2 that relate to programming/my
career and two around other interests. Right now I'm looking at [edX's
Astrophysics series](https://www.edx.org/xseries/astrophysics) and [Practical
Deep Learning For Coders](http://course.fast.ai/start.html). I'll fill in
the other two once those are complete.
