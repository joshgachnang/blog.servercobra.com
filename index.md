Hey! I'm Josh, a software developer in Chicago, IL. I currently work at [Triggr Health](https://www.triggrhealth.com), helping to transform the way addiction treatment is delivered. I write Swift, Javascript, Node, Python, Angular, Ionic, and a bunch of other stuff, depending on the day. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/servercobra) and [GitHub](https://github.com/pcsforeducation).
